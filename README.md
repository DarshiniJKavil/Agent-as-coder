This project is an AI-powered T1-T4 compliant PDF parser agent designed to extract structured data from bank statements such as ICICI. It automatically generates a parser, tests it against a target CSV, and outputs a ready-to-use parser script. The agent supports multi-page PDFs, extracts transaction details and account information, and saves the results in CSV format. Users can run the parser via the command line (python agent.py --target icici), which produces the parsed CSV, a custom parser in custom_parsers/, and a test file in tests/. Dependencies include pandas, PyPDF2, and pdfplumber, and the system is fully tested for accurate extraction with minimal setup.
